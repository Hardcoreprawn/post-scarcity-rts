# The Tinkers' Union

> *"If you can't open it, you don't own it."*

## Overview

The Tinkers' Union grew out of the maker movement, right-to-repair activists, and open-hardware communities who refused to accept the Forge as a black box. While the Collegium wants to share fabrication blueprints, the Tinkers go further: they want everyone to *understand* what they're building.

They're engineers, hobbyists, garage inventors, and hackerspace veterans. They don't just use technology — they take it apart, improve it, and share the modifications. Their philosophy: planned obsolescence is a crime, proprietary systems are prisons, and anyone who can hold a wrench should be able to fix their own world.

They're not desperate survivors. They're people who *chose* to build things the hard way because the hard way is the honest way.

## Aesthetic

- **Visual:** Custom-built mechs, modular vehicles, 3D-printed components, workshop aesthetics
- **Colors:** Safety orange, workshop blue, bare aluminum, cable-management greens
- **Architecture:** Modular, reconfigurable, covered in labeled parts and hanging tools
- **Sound:** Power tools, servos, diagnostic beeps, the hum of fabricators
- **Mood:** Maker pride, creative chaos, "measure twice, cut once"

## Playstyle Identity

| Aspect | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Economy | Field repairs, modular recycling |
| Expansion | Mobile workshops, flexible positioning |
| Combat | Fast, modular, endlessly customizable |
| Tech | Non-linear, unlock components not units |
| Weakness | Each unit is custom — lose it, lose the investment |

### Strategic Summary

The Tinkers win through adaptation and clever engineering. Their modular mechs can be reconfigured mid-battle, and their mobile workshops mean they're never far from repairs. They can't mass-produce like others, but every unit they field is exactly what they need.

**Win Condition:** Out-adapt, out-tinker, field the right tool for every job.

**Lose Condition:** Lose your veteran units, get caught before reconfiguring.

## Narrative Role

The Tinkers' Union represents radical self-sufficiency. They don't want to share the Collegium's blueprints — they want everyone to *understand* them. They don't want the Continuity Authority's managed abundance — they want the right to build, break, and rebuild their own world.

They're not fighting for survival. They're fighting for the principle that technology should belong to the people who use it, not the people who license it.

But self-sufficiency can become isolation. Independence can become tribalism. And "we don't need anyone" can become "we don't *want* anyone."

### The Dark Path: Fortress Mentality

**What happens when the Tinkers' Union wins completely:**

When everyone builds their own walls, who builds the bridges? The Tinkers' dream of self-sufficient communities becomes a nightmare of isolated enclaves, each convinced they're the only ones doing it right, each suspicious of outsiders, each slowly losing the shared knowledge that made civilization possible.

In the **Dark Victory** ending:

- **Balkanization** — Humanity fragments into a thousand tiny kingdoms
- **Technology Hoarding** — "Open source" becomes "our source only"
- **Outsider Paranoia** — Anyone who didn't build it themselves can't be trusted
- **Knowledge Decay** — Without exchange, innovation stagnates
- **Kira Volkov** becomes the eternal workshop master, protecting her people by cutting them off from everyone else

> *"We don't need their help. We never did. And now we'll make sure they can't hurt us."*

### Campaign Arc: "Right to Repair" (10 Missions)

| Mission | Title | Description | Key Choice |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1 | Workshop | Establish the first Makerspace | None (tutorial) |
| 2 | Scavenge | Salvage tech from abandoned site | Share designs or keep them |
| 3 | Refuge | Other factions' refugees arrive | Accept or turn away |
| 4 | Competition | Collegium offers partnership | Accept help or go it alone |
| 5 | Siege | Authority blockade threatens survival | Trade or raid |
| 6 | Fracture | Internal dispute over direction | Doc vs Kira's visions |
| 7 | Outsiders | New community wants to join | Open door or closed door |
| 8 | Legacy | What to teach the next generation | Share everything or protect secrets |
| 9 | Reckoning | Face the world you've built | Varies by path |
| 10 | Tomorrow | Shape the Tinkers' future | Varies by path |

### Possible Endings

| Ending | Trigger | Outcome |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| **Dark Victory** | Maximum isolation choices | Fragmented fortress communities |
| **Pyrrhic Victory** | Self-sufficient but alone | Independence at the cost of connection |
| **Compromise** | Trade and share selectively | Networked workshops, open doors |
| **Redemption** | Doc's path, radical openness | Makers who teach, not hoard |

### Key Characters

- **Kira Volkov** — Founder, former industrial designer turned movement leader
- **"Doc" Oyelaran** — Master engineer, unofficial mentor to everyone
- **Jess and Jamie Park** — Twin siblings, ace pilots, channel rivals
