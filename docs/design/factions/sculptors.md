# The Sculptors

> *"Your body should be yours to shape. We're here to help."*

## Overview

The Sculptors began as healers. When the Forge emerged and everyone focused on fabricating *things*, a coalition of gene therapists, surgeons, and bioengineers asked a different question: "If we can make anything... why are we still trapped in bodies we didn't choose?"

They started with medicine. Hereditary diseases, eliminated. Spinal injuries, reversed. Chronic conditions that had tormented families for generations, cured in a single treatment. Then they went further — helping veterans recover from trauma, giving accident survivors their lives back, and finally offering something revolutionary: the freedom to become whoever you truly are.

They're not conquerors. They're artists. Healers. Liberators. Every modification is a collaboration between client and sculptor, designed together, grown to specification. Your body, your canvas. They just provide the tools.

The movement spread through clinics and salons, through grateful patients who became advocates, through a simple message: *You deserve to be yourself.*

## Faction Aesthetic

- **Visual:** Lower tiers look *buff human* — enhanced but recognizable. Higher tiers get *wrong* — too many joints, skin that doesn't sit right, faces that almost remember how to smile
- **Colors:** Clinical white, surgical steel, bruise purple, vein blue, scar-tissue pink
- **Architecture:** Clean medical facilities that feel *too* clean, gallery spaces with uncomfortable exhibits
- **Sound:** Heartbeats, breathing that's slightly off-rhythm, whispered voices, bone cracking
- **Mood:** Uncanny valley — everything looks *almost* right. Tzimisce flesh-craft meets Delaque psychic creep

## Playstyle Identity

| Aspect | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Economy | Patronage system, quality over quantity |
| Expansion | Salons extend influence, not territory |
| Combat | Elite bespoke units, specialist roles |
| Tech | Customization trees, tailored upgrades |
| Weakness | Expensive units, slow production, vulnerable economy |

### Strategic Summary

The Sculptors win through quality. Their units are individually powerful, highly specialized, and expensive. They don't swarm — they deploy carefully designed forms for specific purposes. Losing units hurts. Keeping them alive wins games.

**Win Condition:** Build the perfect army composition, outmaneuver with specialist superiority.

**Lose Condition:** Economic disruption, attrition warfare, opponents who trade efficiently.

### Economic Buildings

## Narrative Role

The Sculptors represent the most seductive path to dystopia: the road paved with genuine good intentions.

They start as *heroes*. Their technology heals the sick, frees the trapped, and gives people control over their own bodies for the first time in history. In the early campaign, you're doing unambiguously good work — helping people, spreading access, liberating individuals from limitations they never chose.

The slide is gradual. It starts with enthusiasm ("everyone should have this!"), progresses through expectation ("why would anyone refuse?"), and arrives at intervention ("we're helping them, they just don't understand yet").

### The Dark Path: The Beautiful Tyranny

**What happens when the Sculptors win completely:**

When modification becomes the norm, the unmodified become... concerning. Not threatening — just *sad*. Clearly suffering from some kind of body dysmorphia that prevents them from accepting improvement. They need help. They need treatment. They need to be *fixed*.

In the **Dark Victory** ending:

- **Mandatory Optimization** — "Natural" becomes a medical condition requiring treatment
- **Beauty Hierarchy** — The most modified hold the most status
- **Aesthetic Conformity** — "Personal choice" somehow always leads to approved forms
- **Compassionate Coercion** — "We're not forcing you. We're healing you."
- **The First Sculptor** becomes the eternal arbiter of beauty, deciding what "improvement" means

> *"We only want to help. We only ever wanted to help. And now... everyone will be helped, whether they understand they need it or not."*

### Campaign Arc: "Becoming" (11 Missions)

| Mission | Title | Description | Key Choice |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1 | First Do No Harm | Establish a clinic in crisis zone | None (tutorial) |
| 2 | Healing Hands | Treat refugees, gain supporters | Triage priority |
| 3 | Liberation | Help people modify freely | How far to go |
| 4 | Resistance | Some communities reject modification | Respect or persuade |
| 5 | Complications | Side effects emerge | Transparency vs reputation |
| 6 | The Naturals | Meet those who refuse on principle | Coexist or convert |
| 7 | For Their Own Good | Pressure to expand "help" | Volunteer only or... encourage |
| 8 | Aesthetics | Internal debate on what "improvement" means | Who decides beauty? |
| 9 | Treatment | Face what "helping everyone" really means | Major branching point |
| 10 | Mirror | Confront what you've become | Varies by path |
| 11 | Sculpture | Shape the future of humanity | Varies by path |

### Possible Endings

| Ending | Trigger | Outcome |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| **Dark Victory** | Maximum "help" choices | Mandatory modification, beautiful tyranny |
| **Pyrrhic Victory** | Aggressive expansion, some coercion | Modified majority, resentful minority |
| **Compromise** | Accept refusals, respect boundaries | Parallel societies, uneasy coexistence |
| **Redemption** | Dr. Vasquez's path, consent absolute | Voluntary modification, true freedom |

### Key Characters

- **The First Sculptor (Dr. Elara Vasquez)** — Founder, genuine healer, watching her dream curdle
- **Director Omolade** — Operations chief, pragmatist, believes the ends justify the means
- **Kai Chen** — Young sculptor, true believer, can be guided either direction
