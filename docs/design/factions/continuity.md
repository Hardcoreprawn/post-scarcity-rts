# The Continuity Authority

> *"The transition must be managed. That's all we're asking."*

## Overview

The Continuity Authority didn't seize power — they were *asked* to take charge. When the Forge emerged and threatened to upend every economy, every government, every way of life overnight, someone had to manage the transition. Someone had to prevent chaos.

They're the coalition of governments, international institutions, and responsible corporations who said: "We can't just give everyone infinite fabrication and hope for the best." They implemented feedstock licensing, fabrication oversight, and transition protocols — all temporary, of course. Just until society adapts.

That was fifteen years ago.

Now the "temporary" measures are permanent, the oversight has become surveillance, and the licensed fabrication has become rationed production. But the cities are stable. The lights are on. And most people — if they're honest — prefer the certainty.

## Aesthetic

- **Visual:** Professional uniforms, clean vehicles, institutional architecture
- **Colors:** Navy blue, white, silver, tasteful gold accents
- **Architecture:** Modern institutional — glass, steel, efficient, humane
- **Sound:** Professional radio chatter, smooth machinery, ambient hum
- **Mood:** Competent bureaucracy, quiet control, "everything is fine"

## Playstyle Identity

| Aspect | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Economy | Centralized, efficient, scales well |
| Expansion | Methodical, well-defended positions |
| Combat | Professional military, combined arms |
| Tech | Structured progression, reliable upgrades |
| Weakness | Rigid doctrine, slow to adapt |

### Strategic Summary

The Continuity wins through professionalism and overwhelming resources. They build methodically, research efficiently, and field a modern combined-arms military. They don't take risks because they don't have to.

**Win Condition:** Establish secure economy, build superior force, apply decisive pressure.

**Lose Condition:** Early disruption before institutions stabilize, opponents who refuse conventional engagement.

## Narrative Role

The Continuity Authority is designed to make players uncomfortable — not because they're obviously evil, but because they're *not*.

In the early game, they seem reasonable. Measured. Professional. Someone *has* to manage the transition to post-scarcity, right? You can't just give everyone infinite fabrication and hope for the best. The Authority's argument makes sense. Their units have names like "Guardian" and "Peacekeeping." Their buildings are "Research Institutes" and "Training Centers."

But as the campaign progresses, you see what "transition management" really means. The surveillance. The rationing. The "temporary" measures that have lasted fifteen years. The people who disappeared for "destabilizing activities." The comfortable citizens who don't ask questions because asking questions is destabilizing.

### The Dark Path: Eternal Order

**What happens when the Continuity Authority wins completely:**

The "temporary" transition never ends. Why would it? The system works. The cities are stable, the citizens are fed, and order is maintained. If you have to break a few eggs to make that omelet... well, that's a small price for stability.

In the **Dark Victory** ending:

- **Universal Surveillance** — Every fabricator is monitored, every communication logged
- **Thought Crime** — "Destabilizing ideas" become criminal offenses
- **Eternal Emergency** — The transition is permanent; there's always a new crisis
- **Benevolent Totalitarianism** — Citizens are comfortable, docile, and unfree
- **Director-General Vasquez** becomes the eternal administrator, genuinely believing she saved humanity

> *"We prevented chaos. That's all we ever wanted. And now... we'll prevent it forever."*

### Campaign Arc: "Orderly Transition" (11 Missions)

| 3 | Protocols | Establish monitoring systems | Surveillance level |
| 4 | Crossroads | First contact with Collegium | Negotiate or suppress |
| 5 | Escalation | Tinkers' Union resistance | Proportional or overwhelming response |
| 6 | Questions | Internal dissent emerges | Support Coordinator Chen or silence her |
| 7 | The Cost | Civilian casualties mount | Cover up or acknowledge |
| 8 | Loyalty | Choose between duty and conscience | Major branching point |
| 9 | Reckoning | Face consequences of choices | Varies by path |
| 10 | Endgame | Final confrontation | Varies by path |
| 11 | Aftermath | Epilogue mission | Only on some paths |
