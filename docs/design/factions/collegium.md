# The Collegium

> *"Knowledge is the only resource that grows when shared."*

## Overview

The Collegium emerged from universities, research institutes, and open-source movements that saw post-scarcity as humanity's greatest opportunity. They believe the Forge should be freely available to all — fabrication blueprints shared openly, knowledge distributed without gatekeepers.

They're idealists, but not naive. They know the Continuity Authority will never willingly give up control, and they're prepared to fight for a future where abundance serves everyone.

## Aesthetic

- **Visual:** Academics, modular buildings, clean energy, drone swarms
- **Colors:** White, blue, soft green
- **Architecture:** Modular, hexagonal, self-assembling
- **Sound:** Electronic hums, chimes, drone buzzing
- **Mood:** Optimistic technology, collective progress

## Playstyle Identity

| Aspect | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Economy | Fast expansion, distributed processing |
| Expansion | Rapid, but fragile holdings |
| Combat | Swarms of cheap drones, flexibility |
| Tech | Branching tree, adaptable |
| Weakness | Expensive individual units weak, vulnerable to burst damage |

### Strategic Summary

The Collegium wins through expansion, adaptation, and numerical superiority. Their individual units are weak, but they're cheap and easily replaced. They tech quickly and adapt to counter enemy strategies.

**Win Condition:** Out-expand, out-tech, and overwhelm with efficiency.

**Lose Condition:** Get contained, lose too many workers, fall behind in expansion.

## Narrative Role

The Collegium represents hope — the belief that technology can liberate rather than oppress. They're the idealists who think information wants to be free and that sharing knowledge is always good.

But they face hard questions: Can knowledge truly be neutral? Do they have the right to force freedom on others? What happens when "open access" becomes mandatory compliance?

### The Dark Path: Tyranny of Experts

**What happens when the Collegium wins completely:**

When everyone *must* be educated, when all decisions *must* be data-driven, when the "objectively correct" answer is the only answer allowed... you get a new kind of tyranny. Not jackboots and surveillance, but peer review and "scientific consensus" enforced at gunpoint.

In the **Dark Victory** ending:

- **Mandatory Enlightenment** — Education becomes indoctrination; dissent is "ignorance"
- **Algorithmic Governance** — ARIA and the AIs decide what's "optimal" for humanity
- **Credential Caste** — Those without proper education become second-class citizens
- **Forced Transparency** — Privacy is "inefficient"; all data is shared, always
- **Chancellor Tanaka** becomes the eternal educator, convinced she's liberating humanity from their own stupidity

> *"We didn't force anyone to agree with us. We just made disagreement... irrational."*

### Campaign Arc: "Open Source" (10 Missions)

| Mission | Title | Description | Key Choice |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1 | First Contact | Share the Forge with a village | None (tutorial) |
| 2 | Expansion | Establish second campus | Speed vs thoroughness |
| 3 | Resistance | Continuity Authority responds | Fight or flee |
| 4 | Converts | Former Authority citizens join | Integrate or re-educate |
| 5 | Doubts | ARIA questions its programming | Trust ARIA or limit it |
| 6 | Schism | Professor Adeyemi challenges methods | Support him or dismiss him |
| 7 | Zealots | Collegium extremists emerge | Embrace or reject them |
| 8 | The Truth | Discover uncomfortable data | Share everything or curate |
| 9 | Reckoning | Face the consequences | Varies by path |
| 10 | New World | Shape the future | Varies by path |

### Possible Endings

| Ending | Trigger | Outcome |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| **Dark Victory** | Maximum "enlightenment" choices | Technocratic dictatorship of "reason" |
| **Pyrrhic Victory** | Force-spread knowledge | Knowledge shared, wisdom lost |
| **Compromise** | Work with other factions | Open knowledge with consent |
| **Redemption** | Adeyemi's path, respect autonomy | Slower spread, genuine freedom |

### Key Characters

- **Chancellor Yuki Tanaka** — Leader, believer in radical openness
- **Professor Obi Adeyemi** — Military strategist, reluctant warrior
- **ARIA** — AI advisor, questions its own freedom
