# The Zephyr Guild

> *"Control the skies, control the world."*

## Overview

The Zephyr Guild doesn't care about ideology. They care about profit, power, and freedom of movement. When everyone else was fighting over the Forge, they took to the skies — building floating platforms, zeppelin fleets, and trade networks that span the world.

They sell to everyone, fight for anyone who pays, and answer to no one. In a world of ideological warfare, they're the opportunists who profit from chaos.

## Aesthetic

- **Visual:** Zeppelins, sky-platforms, brass and gold, aviator gear
- **Colors:** Gold, sky blue, brass, white
- **Architecture:** Floating, modular, temporary
- **Sound:** Propellers, wind, radio chatter, steam
- **Mood:** Adventure, freedom, moral ambiguity

## Playstyle Identity

| Aspect | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Economy | Trade routes, resource stealing |
| Expansion | Mobile bases, no permanent territory |
| Combat | Air superiority, harassment, raids |
| Tech | Balanced, focused on mobility |
| Weakness | Weak ground forces, vulnerable bases, AA counters |

### Strategic Summary

The Zephyr Guild wins through air superiority and economic disruption. They raid enemy harvesters, steal resources, and never fight where the enemy is strongest. Their mobile bases make them hard to pin down.

**Win Condition:** Control the skies, bleed enemy economy, win through harassment.

**Lose Condition:** Enemy builds dedicated AA, bases get caught, forced to ground fight.

## Trade Routes

### Mechanics

Trade Routes are a unique Zephyr mechanic:

- Establish routes between Trade Depots
- Routes generate passive income over time
- Longer routes = more income, more vulnerable
- Enemy can attack trade ships
- Routes through contested territory are risky but profitable

### Route Types

| Route | Distance | Income | Risk |
| ----- | -------- | ------ | ---- |
| **Local** | Same area | 5/s | Low |
| **Regional** | Adjacent area | 10/s | Medium |
| **Continental** | Across map | 20/s | High |

## Narrative Role

The Zephyr Guild represents moral ambiguity. They're not heroes or villains — just people who found freedom in the chaos and don't want to give it up. They'll fight for whoever pays, and switch sides when the price is right.

But "freedom" without responsibility is just selfishness with better marketing. And when the Guild's profit motive meets desperate people... who really benefits from their "services"?

### The Dark Path: Sky Tyrants

**What happens when the Zephyr Guild wins completely:**

The skies belong to the Guild. And everything moves through the skies. Food, medicine, technology — all of it flows through Guild routes, at Guild prices, on Guild terms. They didn't conquer the world. They just made everyone else rent it.

In the **Dark Victory** ending:

- **Monopoly of Movement** — Nothing moves without Guild approval
- **Extraction Economy** — Every trade route is a toll road
- **Mercenary World** — Protection is just another service (pay up or else)
- **Freedom for Sale** — Liberty exists, but only those who can afford it
- **Admiral Okafor** becomes the eternal sky lord, selling freedom to those who can pay

> *"We don't control anyone. We just... facilitate. For a reasonable fee."*
