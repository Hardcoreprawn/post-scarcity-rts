# Development Review (Jan 26, 2026)

## Scope

This review summarizes current progress vs. the roadmap and GDD, and highlights gaps, risks, and recommended improvements.

## Executive Summary

You have a strong foundation: deterministic simulation, core RTS loop, basic AI, and robust data files for all factions. The biggest gaps are (1) **game readability/UX**, (2) **faction wiring and differentiation**, and (3) **test infrastructure that makes balance and determinism sustainable**. The GDD also introduces several systems not yet represented in the roadmap, which risks scope drift.

## What’s Working Well

- **Solid technical base**: deterministic simulation, ECS, replay logic groundwork.
- **Roadmap structure**: clear phases, testable exit criteria, and risk mitigation.
- **Content scaffolding**: all faction data authored and validated.
- **Testing culture**: unit and balance tests already present.

## Gaps & Failings (Priority-Ordered)

### 1) Gameplay Readability & UX (High)

**Gap:** Phase 2.7 is partially complete and blocks broader faction testing. Current UX likely fails GDD’s “readable chaos” pillar.

- Missing health bars, selection visuals, damage feedback, placement ghost fix.
- Missing minimap interaction and core RTS commands.
- Production QoL (global queues, hotkeys, reordering) is absent.

**Impact:** Player comprehension and control suffer; new faction testing becomes noisy and misleading.

### 1.5) Graphics Quality & Visual Identity (High)

**Gap:** Visuals are still largely placeholder and lack faction identity, animation polish, and combat readability.

- Sprites are basic; silhouettes and faction differentiation are not yet clear at strategic zoom.
- Missing animation sets (idle/move/attack/death) and impact VFX/SFX cues.
- Terrain, lighting, and post-processing appear unaddressed for mood and clarity.

**Impact:** Perceived quality is low, gameplay feedback is weak, and marketing assets (screenshots/trailer) will underperform.

### 2) Faction Differentiation Is Data-Only (High)

**Gap:** Faction data is authored, but not wired into spawning, selection, or real gameplay.

- Phase 3.2 is the bottleneck; until solved, faction work is largely theoretical.
- GDD expects distinct economy twists and unit behaviors that are not yet modeled.

**Impact:** You can’t validate balance, identity, or AI behaviors across factions.

### 3) Systems in GDD Not Reflected in Roadmap (High)

Several GDD systems aren’t visible as roadmap milestones, which risks silent scope growth:

- **Fog of war, line of sight, cover, height advantage**
- **Veterancy**
- **Multiple victory conditions** (domination, economic victory)
- **Campaign, tutorials, and narrative structure**
- **Accessibility features** (rebinds, colorblind modes, UI scaling)

**Impact:** Potentially large work items with no schedule or ownership.

### 4) Balance Testing Infrastructure Is Incomplete (Medium)

**Gap:** Balance tests exist, but they aren’t actionable until faction wiring and headless sim runner exist.

- Regression testing and determinism validation are not yet automated.

**Impact:** Balance regressions and desync risks will become expensive later.

### 5) AI Roadmap vs. GDD Expectations (Medium)

**Gap:** GDD promises deep AI personalities and difficulty tiers; roadmap still at basic threshold logic.

**Impact:** Skirmish value, perceived quality, and retention will lag.

### 6) Documentation Drift Risk (Low–Medium)

**Gap:** Architecture docs describe modules that may not match current workspace layout.

**Impact:** Onboarding and system comprehension degrade as the project grows.

## Risk Register Additions

- **Scope creep from GDD systems** not on roadmap (fog of war, cover, campaign).
- **Balance validation debt**: will compound when more factions unlock.
- **UX debt**: will pollute playtest feedback and balance evaluation.

## Recommendations (Concrete Next Steps)

### Immediate (Next 2–4 Weeks)

1. **Finish Phase 2.7** (visual feedback, core commands, minimap interaction, production QoL).
2. **Wire FactionData into spawns** (Phase 3.2) so real faction testing can begin.
3. **Add a minimal Fog of War + LoS prototype** or explicitly defer in roadmap.
4. **Define a graphics quality bar** (sprite readability, animation minimums, VFX checklist) aligned to Phase 2.7/6.

### Short Term (Next 4–8 Weeks)

1. **Headless simulation runner** (Phase 3.5.2) to unlock balance automation.
2. **Determinism regression checks in CI** (Phase 3.5.5).
3. **AI decision cadence + basic personalities** (Phase 4.1/4.5).

### Mid Term (Next 2–3 Months)

1. **Document GDD-to-roadmap alignment**: add missing systems or formally defer.
2. **Accessibility baseline**: input rebinding + UI scaling options.

## Technical Mentor Feedback (Professional Critique)

### Determinism & Simulation Integrity

- **Risk:** Bevy/engine integration can leak nondeterminism (timers, random seeds, floating precision, iteration order).
- **Action:** Centralize all RNG with seeded deterministic streams; add state-hash checks per tick and log divergence in dev builds.

### Data-Driven Systems & Validation

- **Risk:** RON data files will grow; missing or inconsistent fields will become brittle.
- **Action:** Add schema validation and lint rules (cost bounds, missing icons, tech prerequisites); fail fast in CI.

### Performance Budgeting

- **Risk:** Early “looks fine” can hide future scaling cliffs (pathfinding, selection, combat, UI updates).
- **Action:** Add targeted benchmarks: pathfinding for 1k units, combat resolution bursts, UI redraw cost; track in CI or nightly.

### Asset Pipeline & Tooling

- **Risk:** Placeholder art will delay polish and make iteration slow.
- **Action:** Define a repeatable sprite pipeline (naming conventions, atlas build, validation, hot reload) and a “minimum viable animation set.”

### Testing Strategy Balance vs. Playability

- **Risk:** Balance tests before faction wiring can give false confidence.
- **Action:** Gate balance tests behind “factions wired” status; prioritize headless sim runner to make tests meaningful.

### Architecture & Documentation Drift

- **Risk:** Docs reference modules that may not exist or have moved, eroding onboarding quality.
- **Action:** Add a quarterly “doc drift” review; enforce docs updates in PR templates for architectural changes.

### Networking & Replay Foundations

- **Risk:** Replay and lockstep require the same deterministic command stream, but current structure may diverge.
- **Action:** Ensure commands are the sole simulation input; render/UI must be fully decoupled from sim state mutations.

## Publisher/Developer Feedback (2026 Market Expectations)

### GDD Market Fit & Scope

- **Strength:** Clear thematic hook and faction identity; strong narrative premise for marketing.
- **Risk:** GDD scope is closer to AA ambitions (campaigns, multiple victory modes, deep AI, esports-viable balance). This is feasible but requires explicit sequencing and budget discipline.
- **Expectation:** Publishers will want a **shippable MVP** plan: one polished faction, 2–3 maps, strong UX, and replayable skirmish before multi-faction content.

### Gameplay Expectations (2026 RTS Audience)

- **Must-haves:** Responsive controls, readable combat, core RTS commands, and a competent AI baseline.
- **Nice-to-have but expected:** Spectator tools, replays, quality-of-life hotkeys, and strong onboarding (tutorial or first-time UX).
- **Risk:** Without clarity in the first 10 minutes (UI feedback, readability), players churn regardless of long-term depth.

### Visual/Model Quality (Art & Presentation)

- **Expectation:** Even indie RTS titles in 2026 are judged on **readability, cohesion, and animation feel** more than raw fidelity.
- **Gap:** Placeholder sprites and limited animation will be perceived as “prototype,” which impacts store performance and wishlists.
- **Recommendation:** Define a visual target (style guide, palette, silhouette rules) and a minimum animation set before public demos.

### Production & Milestone Readiness

- **Publishers look for:** A stable vertical slice with convincing gameplay loop and marketable visuals.
- **Missing:** Clear “vertical slice” gate in the roadmap. Add a milestone that locks UX, one faction, and art quality to demo standard.

### Business & Platform Expectations

- **Steam readiness:** Wishlist funnel depends on trailer and screenshots; art polish and UI clarity are the biggest drivers.
- **Competitive viability:** Balance and determinism are important, but **player-perceived fairness** (UI clarity, responsiveness) will be weighed more heavily in early access feedback.

### Recommendation Summary

- Define a **Vertical Slice milestone** (one faction, 2–3 maps, full UX polish, minimum VFX/animation, tutorial).
- Align GDD scope to **phased release goals** (e.g., skirmish-first early access, campaign later).
- Treat presentation quality as a **production gate**, not a Phase 6 afterthought.

## Player/Fan Critique: Faction Identity & Differentiation

### Where It Feels Overly Derivative

- **Continuity Authority** reads as a familiar “authoritarian empire” archetype. Without a unique mechanic or cultural twist in play, it risks blending into generic “militarized order” factions.
- **Collegium** leans into the “tech-utopian scientists” trope. It needs a signature gameplay hook beyond faster expansion and drones.
- **Tinkers’ Union** parallels common “scrappy scavengers.” The salvage mechanic is promising, but it needs to be *front-and-center* in feel and moment-to-moment play.
- **Zephyr Guild** carries strong “sky pirates/merchant guild” vibes. Air superiority is common; it needs a distinct economic or territorial dynamic to stand apart.

### Where It’s Ambiguous or Hard to Relate

- **Sculptors/Bio-Sovereigns naming** feels inconsistent across docs, which weakens identity. The player needs a clear fantasy: are they artists of flesh, post-human idealists, or bio-industrial pragmatists?
- Several faction “good intentions” are strong in lore, but **don’t yet map cleanly to gameplay verbs**. Players relate more to *what they do* than to manifesto text.

### Differentiation Gaps (Gameplay Identity)

- The factions are currently **stat variations** rather than **systemic variations**. Without a unique economy loop or strategic constraint, they feel like reskins.
- The GDD promises ideological tension, but **match goals are identical** (destroy enemy base), which compresses identity.

### Improvements to Strengthen Identity (Concrete)

- **Give each faction one signature rule-breaker** (e.g.,:
  - Continuity: supply “rationing” that throttles unit spam but unlocks burst production windows.
  - Collegium: shared tech networks that scale with map control rather than base size.
  - Tinkers: modular units that swap parts in the field, emphasizing adaptability.
  - Sculptors: custom growth paths or “evolution” tiers with irreversible body upgrades.
  - Zephyr: trade routes and interception mechanics that create a roaming economy.
).
- **Tie UI feedback and audio** to faction identity (distinct production cues, attack sounds, UI styling).
- **Clarify faction fantasy** in one-line player verbs (e.g., “Continuity: fortify and control,” “Collegium: expand and swarm,” “Tinkers: improvise and adapt,” “Sculptors: evolve and specialize,” “Zephyr: raid and relocate”).

### Summary (Player Lens)

The worldbuilding is compelling, but the factions **need clearer, visible gameplay signatures** to be memorable. If each faction has a unique economy loop, a signature unit/ability, and distinct audiovisual cues, the identities will land. Right now they risk feeling like familiar archetypes with new names.

## Suggested Roadmap Edits (High Value)

- Add a **“GDD Alignment”** section to Phase 2.7 or Phase 3, with explicit entries for:
  - Fog of war + line of sight
  - Cover/height modifiers
  - Veterancy
  - Additional victory conditions
- Add an **“Accessibility”** subsection to Phase 2.7 (or Phase 6 if intentionally deferred).

## Summary

The project is on a strong technical footing and is close to becoming genuinely playable. The critical path is now **clarity and control (UX)** and **faction differentiation (data → gameplay)**. If you complete Phase 2.7 and wire FactionData, you can unlock meaningful balance and AI work. Ensure the roadmap explicitly addresses GDD systems to prevent hidden scope from derailing the schedule.
